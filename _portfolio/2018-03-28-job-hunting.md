title:  Job Hunting - and the Challenges
---

When looking for work there is one part that I think most people seem to dread, *the hunt*.  Here's a little peak at what has been going on behind the scenes for a bit recently.

---

I have taken about the last 3 weeks away from the actual checkpoints and core curriculum of school and started my job hunt.  The resume is up to date, I've had contact with a big corporate company, and I think I've figured out some direction in the process.

---

I won't speak on the Resume as it is live on this site and available for your viewing.  Please feel free to navigate over there using the Resume link on the top of the page if that is what you're looking for!  As far as the communication with a large corporate company goes, I have been in touch with Publix Corporate located in Lakeland, FL.  I have been getting some valuable input and feedback from Managers of several different departments including some do's and don'ts, what I need to do to further my chances within their company, as well as other ways to get my foot in the door.  I won't venture to say I was opposed to other methods of getting my feet wet, but that would be rather discouraging as I have spent this time to learn development and not go back to my old IT ways.  I continued to keep my eyes on their job postings page while speaking to a member of their Strategy Team weekly.  About last week when when logging into my Bloc Coursework I had a message from Bloc Support stating my Mentor had quit working for Bloc and I needed to choose a new mentor.  This is right before an exam so I was a little beside myself to say the least.  I went ahead and chose a new mentor and had my first meeting today.

This meeting was a breath of fresh air.  My mentor, Mark, is awesome.  He let me state anything I needed to to figure out where I'm at, why I'm there, and how to progress.  Then he laid out a straightforward gameplan for me to execute.  By the end of the meeting we were able to pinpoint some weaknesses, set a gameplan for further evaluating, and also identify some missed oppurtunities.  One of the main ones that I am looking forward to is attending some Hackathons - so if any of you know of some upcoming ones in 2018 please let me know so that I can get out to them!  I'm also going to be much more diligent with my meet ups, regardless of topic.  Networking is a huge deal, and you never know what you can learn or pick up from just mingling with like minded individuals.  I might even learn about some new oppurtunities that I wouldn't otherwise have the chance to hear about.

The job hunt was rather discouraging up until today.  I had only heard from Publix Corporate, and that wasn't moving how I had wanted it to.  I was applying for jobs, but maybe I was being too picky?  After all they say your first Dev job doesn't need to be your dream job.  It needs to be somewhere that you can learn and further develop.  Mark gave me a very solid piece of advice today that I think I am going to give a shot.  "Apply for everything.  10 years experience - Apply.  Don't have all of the preferred languages - Apply.  Not the ideal spot to work for you on paper - Apply.  Apply for everything, Mark.  Put it in their hands.  You don't get to make the final decision on if you get the job, so let them make that decision.  You might be surprised at what you find, and if it's not the ideal workplace for you and you do get an offer, you can always turn it down." .  This is perhaps one of the best pieces of advice I have received from a mentor.  Any mentor.

Just to wrap things up here because I have some more work that needs to be done, I'd like to say I look forward to working with Mark here in the future and I also look forward to grinding out this next "Checkpoint" as we will call it on the road to a Developer Job.  I'm going to try to be more diligent with posts moving forward from here to keep the site up to date with current happenings.  As always, if you have any questions, comments, requests, advice OR even just want to chat about some coding - Shoot me a message in the contact tab and I'll be sure to get back to you!
