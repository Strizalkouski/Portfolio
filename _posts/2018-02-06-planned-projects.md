The first side project which I am currently working on is developing a website for my good friend, and United States Paralympic Snowboarded - Michael Minor.  Mike and I have been friends since High School, he was always the crazy one in the bunch and we were practically brothers throughout High School and College.  As a way to support my long time friend I am working on designing his personal page as an Olympic Athlete.  He is set to compete in just a few weeks, and is the favorite to bring home the Gold Medal from Pyeonchang in the Paralympics.  I am really looking forward to providing fans a way to connect with Mike, as well as get some fantastic experience working with a top tier athlete.

The second project is for a co-worker of mine.  She is an aspiring cake artist who does really fantastic work.  She doesn't currently have a platform to reach new clients however, so I have offered to create her web page as well.  This web page will feature online ordering functionality, as well as showcase some of her fantastic work!  Kayla is a new mother looking to run her own business rather than work for someone else, so I really look forward to helping her, and gaining this experience in the process!
