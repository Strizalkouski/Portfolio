My name is Mark Strizalkouski.  I am a 27 year old who transitioned from the world of low voltage electric - i.e. Fiber, CAT Cable, Security, Fire, etc.  I have been a project manager wiring jobs such as Amalie Arena, Tropicana Field, and Raymond James Stadium as well as all of the John Deere Nortrax sites in Quebec Canada after they aquired Sigma.  Development has always been something I wanted to do, so the transition was only a matter of time.  

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing with my two dogs, and playing with tech or video games.  I am originally from Pennsylvania, just outside of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area.  I relocated to Florida in 2015 after marrying my wife to move on to better weather and oppurtunities.  

I attended Penn State for 3 years majoring in Information Sciences and Technology before coming into some hardship which forced me to stop attending.  From there I continued to work in the IT industry working at a NOC located in Scranton, PA called BurstNet before the later were bought out by another company in the Carolinas.  My development schooling started in High School where we worked with basic languages such as HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, and C++.  After leaving behind Low Voltage however I have attended Bloc.Io where I schooled in full stack web development.  It is run like a mentorship, and involves both self teaching as well as learning from someone who had been in the industry for some time.  

My goal within the next 5 years is to move from a junior role to a senior role with a medium to large sized company OR secure a role with a smaller startup that I share very strong beliefs with.  At the end of the day, the best work will come from someone paired with a company that they believe in.  When work has meaning, you can really pull the best out of someone.  

If you have any questions or if you would like to talk more in depth to get to know me for possible oppurtunites or even just to network please email me at markstrizalkouski@gmail.com.  I will be able to make time to either message back and forth or schedule a video chat to talk more in depth.

Thank you again - have a wonderful day!
